# Multipage Website Project

**Project Idea:** Blog Website (Simplified)

**Description:** A simple three-page blog website featuring a homepage with an introduction and latest posts, an about page with information about the blog, and a contact page with a form for users to send messages.

**Live Website URL:** [YOUR DEPLOYED WEBSITE URL HERE - e.g., https://your-github-username.github.io/your-repo-name/]

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* `index.html`: The homepage of the blog.
* `about.html`: The about page with information about the blog and author.
* `contact.html`: The contact page with a form and contact information.
* `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the entire website, including basic layout and responsiveness.
* `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for form validation on the contact page.

## Features Implemented

* **Three Responsive Pages:** Home, About, and Contact, accessible through a navigation menu.
* **Semantic HTML5 Structure:** Uses appropriate HTML5 elements for structure and meaning.
* **CSS3 Styling:** Provides a consistent visual design and layout across all pages.
* **Responsive Design:** Implemented using media queries in CSS to adapt the layout for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). The navigation transitions to a more mobile-friendly layout on smaller screens.
* **JavaScript Form Validation:** The contact form on the `contact.html` page includes client-side validation for the Name, Email (with basic format checking), and Message fields. Error messages are displayed for invalid input.
* **Clear Navigation:** A simple navigation menu in the header allows easy movement between the three pages.

## How to View

1.  **Access the Live Website:** Open the provided live website URL in a web browser.
2.  **Navigate:** Use the links in the header (Home, About, Contact) to move between the different pages.
3.  **Test Responsiveness:** Resize your browser window to observe how the layout adapts to different screen sizes. Pay attention to the navigation and the flow of content.
4.  **Test Contact Form Validation:** Navigate to the Contact page and try submitting the form with empty fields or an invalid email address. Error messages should appear. Enter valid data and click "Send Message" to see the (simulated) success message.

## Attempting the Instructions

* **Using CSS3 for styling:** All visual presentation is handled through `style.css`.
* **Using JavaScript for interactivity:** Form validation is implemented in `script.js`.
